# VBC Wireless Gamepad

The VBC Wireless Gamepad enables wireless control of a generic Windows game controller, allowing it to be used with a wide range of flight simulators and games. While some simulators natively support the protocol developed by Mikado, they remain in the minority. The VBC Wireless Gamepad fills this gap by providing a versatile solution that can be used with any simulator or game that supports Windows joysticks.
